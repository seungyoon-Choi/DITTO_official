# Dynamic Time-aware Continual User Representation Learning

## Introduction
Implementation of **Dynamic Time-aware Continual User Representation Learning**.  
Continual user representation learning method in a practical scenario. The key idea is transfer learning for both forward/backward directions to prevent catastrophic forgetting while allowing the previous knowledge to adapt to the current data distribution.


## Basics
1. The main train code is in `train_ditto.py`.
2. The inference code is in `inference_past_tasks_update.py`.
