# Dynamic Time-aware Continual User Representation Learning

## Introduction
Implementation of **Dynamic Time-aware Continual User Representation Learning**  

Continual learning method with replay approach on graph structured data. The structure learning framework and experience replay approach were used to prevent catastrophic forgetting.  


## Basics
1. The main train code is in `train_ditto.py`
2. The inference code is in `inference_past_tasks_update.py`
